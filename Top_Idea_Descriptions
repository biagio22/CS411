Top 2 Idea Descriptions:

1) Daily Briefing App:
This project will aggregate a number of important data sources into an easily readable format.
It will pull in current weather information, daily events from Google Calendar, and top news stories
as well as a Daily Mix playlist from Spotify. Authentication will take place via both Google and Spotify. 
A database will be used to log previous daily briefings, as well as a rating of the day as completed by the user. 

2) Voting Location Finder
This project will take input from the user of their home address. Based on this input, we will determine their polling 
locations, and route them to this location. Authentication will take place via Uber/Lyft accounts, and our database 
will hold the precinct and ward data for voters in the Greater Boston area.
