 This is Amanda. She is a 32- years old working adult with two kids, a 5-years old and an 8-year old. 
 Every day, she has to drop both her kids to school before she can leave for work and has to pick them up afterwards. 
 Apart from this, she has to figure out the timings of their dance rehearsals and sports practices and integrate them 
 in her schedule. In order to do this efficiently, she opens our daily briefing web app to figure out how she 
 can best plan her day to carry out all these tasks and not be late for work. She can also check the weather updates 
 side by side in order to remember to carry raincoats or umbrellas for both her kids in case of a thunderstorm. 
 With her packed schedule, she barely finds time to sit in front of the television and catch up on the daily news. 
 So, when she opens our daily briefing app in the morning, she makes sure to read a few headlines so she can 
 participate in intellectual conversations with her boss and colleagues.
