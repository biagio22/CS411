Brad is a 21-year-old com student. Brad is known to occasionally have one too many Bush Lights at T’s Pub 
and then wake up in groggy morning dazes. Brad tends to ill manage his time in the morning and is usually 
too focused on trying to get himself out of bed to focus on figuring out how his day is going to pan out. 
Brad opens the daily briefing so he can consolidate his schelude in one place and to help him figure out how what he  
can expect out of his day. In order to see if he’ll need to call and uber to make it on time for to his 12 :00 intro 
to advertising class or if he'll need to bring a rain coat for his 5:00 cocktail with Chad at BU pub with out needing to check 
or cross reference many different apps. Users like brad are users that have consistent weekly secludes but often forget  
to or don’t have the time in the morning to plan in preparing for the day. These users get the most utility from features 
like the weather forecast and transit suggestions that can give them important information about of their day all in one spot.
