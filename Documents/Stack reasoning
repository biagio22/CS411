As a group we felt the most comfortable using java script for both our backend
and frontend because we felt the Node.js express framework for the backend felt the most familiar
and the easiest for us call APIâ€™s with. For the front end we are using React framework to keep the
languages on both ends consistent and because it seemed the quickest and most straight forward to learn. 
Other Backends we considered were Python with Flask but we worried that we would run into problems and complications
later on as the project grows and gets more complicated.
